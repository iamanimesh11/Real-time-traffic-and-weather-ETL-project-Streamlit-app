  <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/www-concept-illustration_114360-2143.jpg?t=st=1744565213~exp=1744568813~hmac=cc0420ee0ca016a8962950768146a9a73c652ef7e93dfd0f6be86f2c3eca7cb6&w=826" alt="API Status" width="200"/>
</p>

> Before cloning and running this project, **please ensure that the API is up and running.**

🔗 **[Visit Project App](https://traffic-api-status.vercel.app/?show_api=1#)**  
Make sure the API is **not down** before proceeding.

💡 Once the API is confirmed to be **live and functional**, you can go ahead and clone the repo, and run the project locally. 
Just follow the steps below 👇


## ✅ Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Internet connection to access external APIs (TomTom, WeatherAPI, etc.)

💡 **Note:**  
Ensure that your system’s firewall or antivirus isn’t blocking Docker containers from making network requests.

## 📊 Logging & Monitoring


This project implements a **centralized logging and monitoring system** using **Grafana Loki**, ensuring transparency, debuggability, and maintainability across all services.

### Key Highlights

- **Structured Logging**  
  All Python scripts across Kafka producers/consumers, Airflow DAGs, and data pipelines generate structured logs with timestamp, service name, event type, and status.

- **Centralized Collection with Grafana Loki**  
  Logs from all services are collected and pushed to Loki using `Promtail`. These logs are accessible in real-time via **Grafana dashboards**.

- **Dockerized Monitoring Stack**  
  - `Grafana` for visualization  
  - `Loki` for log storage  
  - `Promtail` for log shipping  
  These services are configured in `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volume storage.

- **Real-Time Debugging**  
  Logs include all critical operations such as:
  - API calls (Overpass, TomTom, WeatherAPI)  
  - Kafka message flow  
  - Database operations (insert/update/failure)  
  - Retry attempts and error messages  

- **Failover & Local Storage**  
  In case of Grafana/Loki downtime, logs are safely written to local files and retried later to avoid data loss.

- **Security & Hygiene**  
  - API keys and sensitive values are **excluded from log outputs**  
  - Logs are rotated and archived periodically (based on configuration)

### Accessing Logs

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Use log query labels like `{job="airflow"}` or `{job="kafka-producer"}` to filter logs
4. Dashboard panels show service-wise activity, recent errors, and API request status

📷 **Please find sample images of dashboards and logs below**



> ✅ This setup ensures end-to-end visibility into your ETL pipeline operations.

## 🗃️ Data Stored

| Table Name       | Description                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| roads_traffic     | Road metadata from Overpass API |
| traffic_flow_data | Real-time traffic speed data    |
| weather_conditions| Weather data per coordinate     |

## 📊 Future Scope

- **Advanced Analytics & ML Integration:**  
  Implement predictive models for traffic congestion, accident risk zones, or weather-based route recommendations.

- **Real-Time Alert System:**  
  Notify users of traffic anomalies or severe weather via email, SMS, or push notifications.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Integrate tools like Streamlit or Dash for live data visualization and insights.

- **Scalability Enhancements:**  
  Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) using Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines for production readiness.

- **API Gateway & Access Layer:**  
  Build secure REST APIs for external systems to query real-time traffic insights.

- **Data Lake Integration:**  
  Archive historical traffic and weather data to a data lake for long-term analysis and trend forecasting.

Remarks :
As we know in Data Engineering project,its impossible to bear cost of production and only way is to do everything locally for showcasing a project.
